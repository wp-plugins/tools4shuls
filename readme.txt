Here are full instructions (since it can get confusing):
    1. Start here: https://www.paypal.com/us/mrb/pal=LVDLPFDVJB32S
    2. click the "Start now" button then select "business" and click "continue"
    3. Choose "Paypal Payments standard" (the "$0" section) on the next page, and then fill in all the appropriate info on the following pages.

Make sure you use a synagogue administrative email address -- not your own -- when you sign up. This will probably mean that you'll need to create a new account rather than upgrading an existing one. This account is completely free (aside from the roughly 3% per transaction fees).  you don't need any type of account that has monthly fees.
